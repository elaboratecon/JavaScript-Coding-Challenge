## My Solution ##

I built an API using the Module Reveal JavaScript design pattern (blogModule.js).

- I coded most of this in ES6.
- The optional Isotope JS library (enables search & sorting) requires jQuery as a dependancy.
- If you choose not to use the library, the layout will fallback to using Flexbox CSS.

app.js contains the setup instructions and outlines the API parameters.

NOTE: Just noticed a slight issue with the Asc/Desc buttons after the first click; possibly a versioning issue with the Isotope library. Will have to fix later.
